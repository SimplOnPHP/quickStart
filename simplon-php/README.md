Tutorial

You can find an example application of how to use SimplOn PHP in the following
repository: [SimplOnPHP-Tutorial](https://github.com/SimplOnPHP/SImplOnPHP-Tutorial).

SimplOn and DOA
---------------
SimplOn PHP is ment to be a practical example of a framework that implements the 
[Data Oriented Approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLGAWHFEsg7kxGMBGxFfz9txgwDUo0Svhw&v=5ywkEurGfG0) 
to show its advantages over the famous Model View Controller approach and its variations.

The source code is poorly written in most cases. Don't be fooled by that as it will eventually improve. 

Instead try to understand how the DOA concept applied to software development can make it easier
to create and maintain applications.

Collaborate
-----------
Feel free to fork this repository and improve the code.

If you like DOA but think that another language would be more suitable, we can help you making the first steps
to write a DOA framework in your favourite language.
